Flaskify

Welcome to Flaskify! A simple CRUD application built in the spirit of this fine tutorial at https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-crud-web-app-with-python-and-flask-part-one by Mbithe Nzomo, although with a few differences. I'm using PostgreSQL as my database in development and production as well as Heroku for hosting. At this time, users can register, login, and logout. I'm currently working on basic admin duties at this time. You can view my progress at http://radiant-dusk-74298.herokuapp.com.
